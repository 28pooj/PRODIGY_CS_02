# 🖼️ Task 2: Image Encryption Tool – Prodigy Infotech Internship

This project is a **Python-based image encryption and decryption tool** created for Prodigy Infotech Internship (Task 2). It uses pixel manipulation techniques to secure image data by applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel.

---

### ✨ Features

* Encrypts images by modifying pixel values (e.g., swapping or adding values).
* Decrypts images back to their original form.
* Supports common image formats like PNG and JPEG.
* Simple command-line interface for user interaction.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pillow (PIL) library for image processing

---

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```
2. Place the image you want to encrypt in the project folder.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python image_encryption.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt or decrypt your image.

---

### 📌 Example Workflow

**Encrypt:**
Original Image → Encrypted Image (pixels altered)

**Decrypt:**
Encrypted Image → Original Image (restored)

---

### 🎯 Outcome

This project demonstrates the use of basic pixel manipulation for image encryption and decryption, ensuring image data privacy in a simple yet effective way.
